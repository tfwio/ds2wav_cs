[the 'more than you need to know' section...]

Once upon a time, I had actually written this into a 12-channel step-sequencer;
albeit, with a not so practical UI, edit and save features were dismally
minimal to say the least...

The more powerful your machine (PC), the betterâ€”but I've found that with the synth
version, there is a HUGE speed difference in targeting x86 (WOW64) vs x64 binaries.

(what a surprise)

Even then, not so fun to tinker around with unless you up the 'latency' in a
standard sound device such as DirectSound or WinAPI.  With ASIO and machines
that work properly with NAudio's MediaFoundation whatever-is-called API it
works much much more adequately...

Moral of this story is: x64 targets are lots faster---but then again, I
didn't release the .NET generator version of it since I've already ported
that to C++ upon which managed code pales in comparison.

We'll see if I can repurpose this guy....

About the C++ app (offline: WIP)
------------------

Yep, I decided also to port this to be cross-platform compatible sometime
around September or October of 2016 in C/CPP (using IPlug/WDL_OL).

I'll probably GIT that up here before I start working on the envelope editor
for the UI since I love the one that I'd written (off-line) in CSharp with
undo/redo and pan/zoom capability.  I'll be a happy camper if I can get it
up here by or around DEC 21.
